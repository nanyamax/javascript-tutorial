Static Typing vs Dynamic Types
JS is a dynamically-typed language. this means that we do not explicitly define the types of our variables. Many other languages are statically-typed such as c, c++ and java.
TypeScript is a superset of Js, which allows static-typing. This can make your code verbose and less prone to errors.
